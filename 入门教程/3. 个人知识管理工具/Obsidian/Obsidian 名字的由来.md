# Obsidian 名字的由来

> [Why is Obsidian named so? – Resolved help – Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/why-is-obsidian-named-so/4837/7)

> Silver:  
> Official reason: it’s a metaphor. If your raw, unstable thoughts are lava, then Obsidian is… well, Obsidian. It is your crystallized (and beautiful) knowledge.
> 
> Other reasons: we like Minecraft and Obsidian is (as Licat told me) the hardest block in the original Minecraft (he started playing during alpha I think). Also Obsidian sounds cool to me, personally.
> 
> Coincidentally, Fallout and the Outer Worlds, some of Licat’s favorite games, are related to the game studio called Obsidian Entertainment. I say “related” rather than “developed by” because most of the better Fallout games are developed by Bethesda (and Black Isle), not Obsidian.
